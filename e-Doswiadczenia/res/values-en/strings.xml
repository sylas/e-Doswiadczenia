		<b> Exercise - how to measure the base period of oscilations of the mathematical pendulum </b> 
		<p>
		&bull; At the beginning we propose to measure the base period of the pendulum i.e. time of one oscilation 
		of the pendulum. For this experiment we will need a sliding pendulum and a ball. <br/>
		&bull;  Put together strand and a tripod, then attach  the ball to the strand.
		</p><p>
		&bull; Set the length of the thread and its angle. After that press ACCEPT SETTINGS. <br/>
		&bull; To start motion of the pendulum, press START.
		</p><p>
		&bull; After one full period stop the timer and save the result into a table. <br/>
		&bull; Now let us perform as accurately as possible the same experiment again. Measure the full periods, 
		writing each time the result into the table. Repeat the experiment at least 5 times.
		</p><p>
		&bull;  Next, let&apos;s look at the obtained results and try to answer the question: did we succeed 
		in repeating the experiment accurately? That is, were the results of measurements of the base period equal?
		</p><p>
		&bull; Do you think that the deviations from the individual values measured in this way are large or small?
		&bull; What do you think, from where do these variations come and what are factors influencing
		 the accuracy of measurements? </p>
		&bull; Consider whether there are more accurate ways to measure the base period? <br/><br/>

		&bull; If the image is not sharp, try to move the screen along the optical bench in order to get the best result.

<p><b> Mechanical vibration </b> is a kind of movement, where certain physical quantities alternately increase and decrease over time. Examples of such movement are: motion of a pendulum or the movement of weight hung on a spring. Take a closer look at the movement of the weight hung on a vibrating spring.

It is also a harmonic motion, as is formed under a force, which acts in a direction opposite that spring  has been stretched (or compressed). The force is due to the features possessed by the spring called the coefficient of elasticity. Compressed or stretched spring will be unsustainable and depending on the size of the elasticity coefficient  with varying intensity will strive to achieve a state of equilibrium.

		equal to 485 nm. Remove from the box a convex lens made of glass, with refractive index of 1.5, the radius of 20 cm
		 and the height - 12 cm. <br/><br/>
		 Place it in a distance of 5 cm from the laser (this is the spacing of the grid of the mat).
		  Push start button placed on the cover of the laser. <br/> Does the lens focus the beams or not? Check whether the 
		  light beams of different wavelength would work the same way with that lens?
		   </p><p>
		&bull;  Set the lens at an angle of 45 ° relative to the left edge of the mat. Does the lens still focus the beams? <br/>
		&bull;  Repeat the exercise for lenses made of other materials, but with a radius equal to 20 cm, height - 12 cm. Start 
		with lens made of air. <br/> Why did you get a different result than before?<br/><br/>
		&bull;  Next, examine the diamond and silicon lenses. Think about what causes focusing inaccuracies? <br/>
		&bull;  Repeat above analysis, changing the number of rays passing through the lens. Has changing the number of rays 
		an impact on the quality of focus? </p>

		&bull;  resistor R, <br/>
		&bull;  coil L, <br/>
		&bull;  capacitor C. 
		</p><p>
		The inclusion of the resistor in the circuit causes a loss of energy and generation of heat. The total energy 
		of the system will decrease over time – damped oscilations appear in the circuit. If specific conditions are met, 
		voltages or currents resonance may be observed in RLC circuit. Voltage resonance occurs in  series RLC circuits. 
		It is based on the fact that for a signal of a certain frequency, the sum of voltage on the coil and on the capacitor 
		is equal to zero. Currents resonance occurs in parallel RLC circuits. At a certain frequency the sum of currents 
		flowing through the coil and the capacitor is zero. Both of these phenomena can be very dangerous in the case 
		of more complex systems, because some components may be damaged. 
		</p><p>
		In this e-experiment, you can do among others: <br/>
		&bull;  monitor on an oscilloscope the waveforms of voltage and current in the RLC circuit, <br/>

		<p>  Wave–particle duality is a concept proclaiming that light has a dual nature. It was first presented 
		at the beginning of the twentieth century. According to this theory, in some cases, light behaves like a wave, 
		and others as particle. For example, light interference phenomena is explained by the wave theory of light. 
		Strengthening or weakening of the light beam is explained  as light waves overlaping with their phases in line
		or against. Purely corpuscular theory (which treats light as a collection of particles) does not explain it at all. 
		To keep on equilibrium the wave theory can not explain the photoelectric effect. Therefore it is assumed that 
		light has  corpuscular-wave nature.
